# Integrate with SDC application APIs.
To start using our APIs make sure to send a ```[POST]``` request to ```login``` endpoint to create a token for the current user.


_*NOTE:*_

In order to interact with our Cashier app, You need to use the TOTP algorithm to generate a QR code that holds the ```user_id.TOTP```
